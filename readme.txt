This is an algorithm using Donald Knuth's algorithm x to find bblock designs.

IMPORTANT:

Please instead of installing modules pyncomb and dlx with pip, download the site-packages file I am uploading to repository.

This is because the modules you install via pip are old versions of modules and they cause errors.

I have modified those modules aswell to make them work with Python 3.8
